## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port 30080 Already in Use**
   - Check what's using the port: 
     - Windows: `netstat -ano | findstr :30080`
     - Linux/Mac: `lsof -i :30080`
   - Stop the conflicting service or change the port in docker-compose.yml

2. **Docker Not Running**
   - Windows/Mac: Start Docker Desktop
   - Linux: `sudo systemctl start docker`

3. **Permission Issues**
   - Windows: Run PowerShell as Administrator
   - Linux: Add user to docker group or use sudo

4. **Services Not Starting**
   - Check logs: `docker compose logs -f`
   - Ensure sufficient system resources
